The theme was/is mainly supposed to work on a local server.
You can try installing Wordpress on Cpanel, Xampp, Wampp et cetera.
And then add this theme to your themes folder and voila you have it.

I will be updating the backend code to allow it to be adaptable to any system, 
right now it's not, but I will update it as soon as possible.
